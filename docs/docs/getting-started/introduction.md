# Cluster Documentation

**Cluster** is an open-source research synthesis platform that gives UX research teams the power of tools like Dovetail—with complete data ownership.

## Why Cluster?

Research data is valuable. It represents hours of interviews, usability tests, and customer conversations. Yet most research tools lock this data in proprietary formats on vendor-controlled infrastructure.

Cluster is different:

- **Your files stay in your cloud** — SharePoint, OneDrive, or Google Drive (coming soon)
- **Annotations use open standards** — W3C Web Annotation format, not proprietary schemas
- **Your database, your control** — Self-host on your infrastructure
- **No vendor lock-in** — Export everything, import anywhere

## Key Features
