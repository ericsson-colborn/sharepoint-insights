## Market Trends

### 1. AI-Powered Analysis
Every major player is adding AI: auto-tagging, theme detection, summary generation, conversational Q&A. Dovetail's "Magic" features, Marvin's "Ask Marvin."

**Cluster Implication:** AI is table stakes, but differentiate on transparency (show evidence, not just conclusions).

### 2. Research Democratization
Non-researchers doing research. Tools getting simpler. Notion/Airtable templates competing with specialized tools.

**Cluster Implication:** Must be simple enough for product managers while powerful enough for dedicated researchers.

### 3. Consolidation
UserTesting + UserZoom + EnjoyHQ. Qualtrics expanding. Dovetail adding recruitment features.

**Cluster Implication:** Standalone repositories may get squeezed. Open standards provide escape valve.

### 4. Data Ownership Concerns
Enterprise buyers asking about data portability, sovereignty, vendor lock-in. GDPR, SOC2 requirements.

**Cluster Implication:** This is Cluster's primary differentiator. Lean into data ownership messaging.

### 5. Repository Fatigue
Teams have research everywhere: Notion, Drive, Confluence, Dovetail, emails. Hard to find past research.

**Cluster Implication:** Integration and aggregation matter. Don't be yet another silo.

## Cluster's Competitive Position

### Unique Value Proposition

**"Dovetail-level synthesis with complete data ownership."**

| Dimension | Dovetail/Marvin | Cluster |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Data location | Vendor cloud | Your SharePoint/Drive |
| Data format | Proprietary | W3C Web Annotation |
| Export options | Limited | Full JSON-LD, portable |
| Vendor lock-in | High | None |
| Pricing model | Per-seat SaaS | Self-hosted / lower cost |
| AI features | Extensive | Roadmap |

### Target Segments

1. **Privacy-conscious enterprises** - Regulated industries (healthcare, finance, government)
2. **Research ops teams** - Want control over research infrastructure
3. **Agencies** - Need to hand off data to clients
4. **Open source advocates** - Prefer standards-based tools
5. **Cost-conscious teams** - Can self-host to reduce costs

### Key Messages

1. **"Your data stays yours"** - Files in SharePoint, annotations in your database
2. **"No lock-in"** - W3C standard format, export anytime
3. **"Enterprise-grade, open-source core"** - Security without vendor dependency
4. **"Works with your stack"** - SharePoint/M365 native, Google Drive roadmap

### Competitive Responses

**"Why not just use Dovetail?"**
→ "Dovetail is excellent, but your research data lives in their cloud in their format. Cluster gives you the same synthesis power while you keep the data."

**"Marvin has better AI"**
→ "AI features are on our roadmap. But AI insights are only as valuable as the data they're built on—and you should own that data."

**"Condens already does privacy"**
→ "Condens is good, but still proprietary format. Cluster uses W3C Web Annotation standard—true portability."
